                    <h1>Welcome to Cupper</h1>
                    <br /> This is an easy way for Hal to assemble the queue of students needing his attention. If you know, or can guess how to use this go right ahead. I you need some help see below.</p>

                <h2> What is this:</h2>

                <p> The idea of cupper is to not only make a webpage for my computer science class, but help Hal in the prosess. In the past Hal has been in demand durnng class time and somthimes its hard to know who to help first. This website has the potental to catorigize when students and need him, and also gather questions and subjects thst can be decussed as a whole class. </p>

                <h2> What is this:</h2>

                <p> Using this is super simple. If you look to the top of this page there are three tags.
                    <br /> "Question", thats where you can input your question and join queue.
                    <br /> "Queue" Thats where you can view the que of students.
                    <br /> "Links" The button to the right has some helpfull links
                    <br /> "Syllabus" The other button to the right will direct you to the classes syllabus
